Set up your MongoDB backend: You can use a library like Mongoose to connect to your MongoDB instance and define your database schema. Mongoose provides an easy-to-use API to interact with your database.

Create a server-side API using Node.js: You can create an API using Node.js and Express to fetch data from your MongoDB database and make calls to the Pipedrive API. You can use a library like Axios to make API calls.

Implement caching: To reduce the number of API calls to the Pipedrive API, you can implement caching on your server-side API using a library like Redis. This will allow you to store the data fetched from the Pipedrive API in memory for a certain amount of time, and serve it to your front-end application when needed.

Implement client-side state management: To manage the state of your data on the client-side, you can use a state management library like Redux or MobX. This will allow you to keep your application's state in sync with your backend API and manage the data efficiently.

Use a client-side caching library: You can also use a client-side caching library like Redux Persist or LocalStorage to cache data on the client-side. This will allow you to reduce the number of API calls to your server and provide a better user experience.
